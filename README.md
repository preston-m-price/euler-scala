# euler-scala
See https://projecteuler.net/

This is a project for fun. I've used the Euler Project for problem inspiration when picking up new programming languages. This will never be a collection of solutions for all problems, just those I think I can use to learn or demonstrate an interesting aspect of the Scala language, which I am learning.
